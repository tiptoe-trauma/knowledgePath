# Knowledge Path Explorer
The TIPTOE Knowledge Path Explorer (KPE) is a visual data exploration tool that allows our
targeted user community of trauma center leadership, decision makers, and stakeholders to explore and
extract data about their trauma center from a graph-based knowledge base (KB), the TIPTOE KB. It builds on
and extends data visualization methodologies of the CAFE project. 

The KPE is designed to run alongside the TIPTOE relational database to provide user account access.

TIPTOE survey results and patient outcome data are pulled from a graph database and displayed in a simplified interface designed to facilitate knowledge discovery and decision making.

This project is a work in progress.  Full instructions for deployment and use are not yet provided.
